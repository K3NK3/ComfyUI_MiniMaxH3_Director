"""「段间清理内存」system RAM cleanup between Director segments.

The same routine as the comfyui_memory_cleanup RAM-Cleanup node, run by the
Director itself between segments instead of only at graph start / end:

- flush the system file cache (Windows: SetSystemFileCacheSize; needs the
  increase-quota privilege, otherwise a silent no-op. Linux: malloc_trim),
- trim the working set of every process (EmptyWorkingSet),
- trim this process's working set (SetProcessWorkingSetSize(self, -1, -1)).

Win32 prototypes are declared on private WinDLL handles, so 64-bit handles and
SIZE_T values are passed correctly without touching ``ctypes.windll`` for
other packs.
